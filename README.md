# Backbase
1. Create a series of manual test cases that cover one functionality that you choose
testcases/testcases.txt
2. Automate ( at least two ) of the previously created test cases
features/article/article.feature
features/article/login.feature
3. Provide a test report for executed test cases
please run mvn clean verify -> it will generate report automatically in: target/site/serenity/index.html

4. Provide an overall evaluation report for the application (approach, issues, risks, recommendation, why you chose the test cases to automate, etc.)
5. When the assignment is completed please push your deliverables to a private git repository. The repository must include clear instructions on where to find each deliverable and how to run tests
